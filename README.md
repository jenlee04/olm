# olm
Simple OLM (olfaction language model) trained on . Made for BIONB 3500 final project. 

In this model, I use a neuroscience inpsired framework (olfactory receptors -> olfactory bulb -> piriform cortex -> various heads) to process odorant inputs (gas chromatography - mass spectrometry data in this case) in order to result in two outputs: an odor label and toxicity label.
